# C# Reflections Project

This project is built to meet criteria outlined by netmatters Ltd in my software
development course. It outlines some of the fundamentals of the C# programming
language and the way it can implement object oriented programming fundamentals.

This small project implements objects of a Car class, assigns them attributes 
such as a year, make, model, registration number and current value. It then 
provides functionality for returning these values and overrides the ToString method
to provide a cleaner version of this.
